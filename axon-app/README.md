# Axon frontend

Building:

```
npm install
npm run pack
open index.html
```

## NOTE: Compatibility

I'm using ES6 here, so we can have let-bindings, template literals, etc.

This means that you should only run this on Chrome as it's the only browser I've checked that supports all of the ES 2015 standard.

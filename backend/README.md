Getting setup:

```bash

npm i

# start the server
npm start
```

## Preliminaries

Using [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) for code quality checks, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) for nice compiler checks and smart editor completion.

Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as it has the best support for TypeScript + tooling.

1. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [TSLint Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)

That's it, it has TypeScript support with completion and everything right out of the box.
